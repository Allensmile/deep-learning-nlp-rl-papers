Recent Deep Learning papers in NLU and RL

I think that other people notes are rarely useful, so I'm just listing the interesting for me papers with a few words after them for me to make references in memory.

If you're in such stuff, welcome: [papers' list](./PAPERS2017.md).

I've decided to keep list size feasible, so I've created a new list for 2017. The old one could be accessed [here](./PAPERS.md).
